# Security Controls Mapping Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains materials for a student assignment on security controls mapping between NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 and CIS Controls v8.1. This assignment is designed to help students understand security frameworks and their practical applications in organizational security compliance.

## Assignment Description

In this assignment, students will:
1. Research specific controls from NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 and CIS Controls v8.1
2. Complete a web-based template documenting these controls
3. Map between the two frameworks, identifying relationships
4. Assess implementation status for each control
5. Write a brief report on their findings and observations

This task simulates real-world security compliance documentation that security professionals create and maintain in organizations subject to regulatory requirements or following security best practices.

## HTML Template

The HTML template (`security-controls-template.html`) provides a structured format for students to document their research and mappings. The template includes:

- Separate tabs for NIST controls, CIS controls, and a summary dashboard
- Forms for entering control descriptions, implementation details, and mapping information
- Visual status indicators for implementation readiness
- Simple navigation between different framework sections

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of information security concepts
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari recommended)
- Text editor for the written report
- Internet access for research

### Installation

1. Download the `security-controls-template.html` file from this repository
2. Open the file in any modern web browser
3. No server or special software is required - the template works locally on your computer

### Usage

1. Navigate between tabs using the buttons at the top of the page
2. Fill in the information for each control based on your research
3. Select implementation status from the dropdown menus
4. Add your mapping information in the designated text areas
5. Enter implementation notes for each control
6. Save your work regularly by using the browser's "Save As" function
7. When complete, save the final version for submission

## Submission Requirements

Students should submit:

1. The completed HTML template (simply save the file after filling it out)
2. A written report (1-2 pages) in PDF format addressing:
   - Differences in approach between the frameworks
   - Examples of control mappings and their relationships
   - Challenges encountered in the mapping process
   - Practical applications of security control mapping
3. A list of references used for research

## FAQ

### How do I save my work?

Use your browser's File > Save As function to save the HTML file. Make sure to save it regularly as you work.

### What if the controls seem to map to multiple controls in the other framework?

This is common! Security frameworks often have overlapping or related controls. Document all relevant mappings and explain the relationships in your notes.

### How detailed should my control descriptions be?

Your descriptions should capture the essential purpose and requirements of each control. Aim for 2-3 sentences that clearly explain what the control requires organizations to do.

### Do I need to complete the implementation notes for every control?

Yes. The implementation notes should provide practical considerations for how an organization might implement each control. This demonstrates your understanding of the control beyond just its description.

### What should I do if I'm not sure about the correct mapping?

Consult the official mapping documents listed in the resources section. If still uncertain, make your best assessment based on the control descriptions and functionality, and explain your reasoning in the notes.
